== Description ==

Tired of copying and pasting iPhone application details in your blog?

Just simply click the [new button](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/uquery-widget/screenshots/) that this plugin adds to the write screen (rich editor included) and then paste the application ID or url to uQuery application into the prompt box; easy as that. You can configure the widget to display a uQuery search bar and you can use your own referral ID from Apple for the 'buy from Apple Store link'.
